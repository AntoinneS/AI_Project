Your child or family member might have dengue. It is important for you to carefully watch them
because dengue can rapidly become severe between the third and seventh day of illness when the
fever is going away. Your doctor can order tests to determine if your sick family member has dengue.
Keep the name and telephone number of your doctor available, and call if you have questions. 

With Fever
Bed rest
• Let your sick child or family member rest as much as possible.
Control high fever
•	 Do not give ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), aspirin, or aspirin-

containing drugs.

•	 Sponge the patient’s skin with cool water if fever remains high.
•	 Give acetaminophen or paracetamol (Tylenol) every 6 hours if
needed for high fever (maximum 4 doses per day).
Prevent dehydration
Give plenty of fluids, and watch for signs of dehydration, which occurs
when a person loses too much body fluid from fever, vomiting, or if he or
she does not drink enough fluids. Bring your child or sick family member
to a clinic or emergency room if any of the following signs appear:
•	 Decrease in urination (check • Listlessness, overly agitated,
the number of wet diapers or or confused
trips to the bathroom) •	 Rapid heartbeat (more than
•	 Few or no tears when a 100 beats per minute) 

child cries
 •	 Cold or clammy fingers
•	 Dry mouth, tongue, or lips and toes
•	 Sunken eyes • Sunken soft spot (fontanel) in
an infant’s head
Prevent spread of dengue inside your house
Mosquitoes that bite the affected family member can go on to bite and
infect others.
•	 Allow the sick child or family member to rest and sleep under a 

bed net or use insect repellant while feverish.

•	 Kill all mosquitoes in the house and empty containers that carry 

water on patios.

•	 Place screens on windows and doors to prevent mosquitoes from 

entering the house.

As Fever Goes Away
Watch for warning signs
Although the fever is going away, this phase of
dengue can be dangerous for some patients.
•	 Watch for warning signs as temperature 

declines, 3-7 days after symptoms began.

Return IMMEDIATELY to the clinic or
emergency department if any of the
following warning signs appear:
•	 Severe abdominal pain or persistent vomiting
•	 Red spots or patches on the skin
•	 Bleeding from nose or gums
•	 Vomiting blood or blood in stools
•	 Drowsiness or irritability
•	 Pale, cold, or clammy skin
•	 Difficulty breathing
